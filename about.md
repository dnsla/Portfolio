# About Me

Iâ€™m a Bachelor of Science student majoring in Data Science (graduating August 2025) with a foundation in industrial systems, IT, and programming.

My toolkit includes:  
- Python & R  
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)  
- Tableau, Matplotlib  
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn

This blend of skills supports my passion for exploring data, solving real problems, and growing as a lifelong learner.
