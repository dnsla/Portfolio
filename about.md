  # About Me

  Iâ€™m a Bachelor of Science student majoring in Data Science (graduating August 2025) with a foundation in industrial systems, IT, and programming. I enjoy using data to solve real-world problems and tell meaningful stories through insights and visualizations.

  My toolkit includes:
  - Python & R
  - SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
  - Tableau, Matplotlib
  - pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn
