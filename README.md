# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site is designed to showcase my background, skills, and academic projects as a Data Science student.

## Overview

This portfolio website was created using GitHub Pages. It includes key information about me, links to my work, and ways to connect. It's a central place to highlight my journey and growth in data science and related fields.

## About Me

I’m a Bachelor of Science student majoring in Data Science, with an expected completion date of August 2025. My academic background combines data analytics and statistical modeling with hands-on experience in industrial systems, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs). I also have foundational training in IT and industrial technology, giving me a unique blend of analytical and technical skills.  

My current toolkit includes Python, R (via RStudio), SQL, and Tableau, which I use to explore data, build models, and visualize insights. While my project list is still growing, I look forward to showcasing academic and personal work here soon. I also plan to share my resume and downloadable resources as they’re finalized.

## Technical Stack

Here are the main tools and technologies I use in my data science work:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R  
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Google Colab  
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Matplotlib  
- **Databases & Querying**: SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
