# Analyzing Climate Trends with NASA Data

This project explores long-term climate trends using publicly available datasets from NASA and NOAA. My group and I analyzed monthly time-series data from 1900 to 2025, focusing on three key indicators: atmospheric CO₂ levels, global temperature anomalies, and sea level changes. Our approach involved data parsing, merging, and applying rolling averages and regression techniques to uncover patterns.

## Key Takeaways

- Strong time-lagged correlation observed between CO₂ and temperature  
- Sea level rise mirrors both variables with signs of acceleration  
- Preliminary models show potential but require further refinement  
- Findings support use in education, climate planning, and scientific research
