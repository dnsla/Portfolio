# No Second Stay: Predicting 30-Day Hospital Readmissions

This project explores 30-day hospital readmission risks using a synthetic EHR dataset of 30,000 patients. My group and I built supervised machine learning models to identify which patients were most at risk of returning shortly after discharge. We focused on features like discharge disposition, chronic conditions, and medication count. Our goal was to inform clinical teams about who might benefit from additional post-discharge care.

## Key Takeaways

- Discharge to rehab or nursing facilities was the top predictor of readmission  
- Chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes increased readmission risk  
- Random Forest and XGBoost models both showed modest AUC (~0.56â€“0.57)  
- Risk scoring and feature analysis provide actionable insights for intervention  
- Ethical use and real-world validation are critical before deployment
