# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews

This project applies natural language processing to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews using the IMDB dataset. My group and I processed 50,000 movie reviews from Kaggle, cleaned and transformed the data using TF-IDF, and tested three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and DistilBERT. We evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which performed best.

## Key Takeaways

- DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%) and best captured nuance in language  
- Logistic Regression was nearly as effective (88%) and much faster to run  
- TF-IDF vectorization worked well with linear models and enabled fast experimentation  
- Visualizations helped interpret model strengths and weaknesses  
- Business applications include improved recommendations, content strategy, and market research
